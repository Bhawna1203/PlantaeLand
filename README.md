<h2> Functionality and concepts used </h2>
<h5>The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the user serach their plant and track its progress. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :<br>
1. Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.<br>
2.Simple,intuitive and attractive Design : Use of  EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for user .And detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.<br>
3. RecyclerView: For showing the data of plants i use RecyclerView . I use googleApi data for making things easlier
4. I use room database for tracking the plant progress </h5>
<br><br>
<h2>Future scope</h2>
<h4>The app is currently used by private or individual so i am thinking to add some more features in future in it like identify using camera about the plant diseases so that our farmers can also use it at large level or community level to know more the plant diseses just by clicking the photo.
